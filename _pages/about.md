Koustuv Saha is a Ph.D. Candidate in Agricultural Economics at Purdue University, specializing in gendered labor markets, agricultural productivity, and rural development. His research examines how structural inequalities impact rural labor markets, the effects of agricultural mechanization on employment shifts, and the role of gender in household decision-making.

At Purdue, he has worked as a Graduate Research Assistant, collaborating with Dr. Jacob Ricker-Gilbert and Dr. Kajal Gulati on projects analyzing labor market dynamics, agricultural transformation, and policy interventions. His work has been recognized with the Uma Lele Prize for Best Contributed Paper on Gender and the Ludwig Kruhe Fellowship.

Koustuvâ€™s research contributes to evidence-based policy design, particularly in agriculture, labor markets, and economic development, with implications for improving rural livelihoods and gender equity in farming communities.
